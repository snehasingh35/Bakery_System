# Design Decisions

This document explains the key design decisions made for the Bakery Management System.

## Container Architecture

### Microservices Approach

I chose a microservices approach with separate containers for each service to:
- Improve scalability of individual components
- Allow independent updates and maintenance
- Isolate concerns and failures
- Enable different technology choices for each component

### Database Choice

PostgreSQL was selected as the primary database because:
- It's a robust, mature, and reliable relational database
- It has excellent support for complex queries and data integrity
- Docker images for PostgreSQL are well-maintained and stable
- It works well for the relational data model needed for products and orders

### Redis Caching

Redis was added as a caching layer to:
- Reduce database load for frequently accessed product data
- Improve response times for product listings
- Demonstrate an additional service integration
- Show practical application of caching in a distributed system

### Message Queue with RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ was selected for order processing because:
- It provides reliable message delivery with configurable guarantees
- It enables asynchronous processing of orders
- It decouples the order placement from order processing
- It can handle high throughput of messages when needed
- It provides a management interface for monitoring

## Container Configuration


### Volume Mounts

Persistent volumes were configured for:
- PostgreSQL data to prevent data loss during container restarts
- RabbitMQ data to maintain message queue state
- Redis data to preserve cache between restarts

### Environment Variables

Environment variables were used for configuration to:
- Keep sensitive information like passwords out of source code
- Allow different configurations for different environments
- Follow the twelve-factor app methodology
- Simplify container orchestration

## Application Design

### Backend API Structure

The backend was designed with RESTful principles to:
- Provide a clean separation of concerns
- Enable easy integration with the frontend
- Follow standard API practices
- Allow for potential future mobile app integration

### Worker Service

A separate worker service was implemented to:
- Process orders asynchronously for better user experience
- Handle potential high-load scenarios gracefully
- Demonstrate the use of a message queue in a practical application
- Show how to implement background processing in Docker

### Frontend Architecture

The React frontend was structured to:
- Provide a responsive user interface
- Keep state management simple
- Make API calls efficiently
- Separate concerns between components

## Security Considerations

While this is a demonstration project, several security practices were implemented:
- Container isolation for each service
- Environment variables for sensitive information
- Database user with limited permissions
- Input validation on API endpoints

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to allow for future enhancements such as:
- Adding authentication and authorization
- Implementing payment processing
- Adding inventory management
- Scaling individual services based on load
- Adding monitoring and alerting

## Docker Compose Configuration

The Docker Compose file was organized to:
- Define dependencies between services
- Configure networking appropriately
- Set up health checks
- Define resource limits
- Create named volumes for persistence
